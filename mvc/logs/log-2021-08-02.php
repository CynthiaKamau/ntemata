forward by the services and information technology directors.\r\ninternet-of-things development\r\nadvantages of strategy\r\ndeveloping services in relation to the internet-of-things has been highlighted by the recent article as a potential means of rapid\r\ngrowth through market development, fulfilling the desire of investors for the company to expand. finding a niche and being\r\nable to innovate in it could enhance tt4u’s wider reputation.\r\nsome of the problems in relation to internet-of-things development appear to be an over-concentration on technology rather\r\nthan business requirements. matching business needs with available business technology has been a core competence for\r\ntt4u in the past. adoption of the mieobed approach with its focus on enhanced understanding of clients’ requirements to help\r\nthem transform their business would seem compatible with this new development.\r\nconcerns with strategy\r\nhowever, commitment to particular markets may be risky for tt4u. it has traditionally had a diversified client base, and\r\ncommitment to particular sectors may require significant investment without necessarily guaranteeing success. if, for example,\r\ntt4u wants to provide data hosting services in connection with the data generated by the internet-of-things, it may need\r\nenhanced capacity to process and store the data. if tt4u is to be an early mover, there may be problems with the reliability of\r\nthe technology.\r\nwhatever the sector chosen, tt4u may need to recruit staff with previous experience in work connected with the\r\ninternet-of-things. this may be costly, but may bring to tt4u valuable new expertise at a time when tt4u is looking\r\ngenerally to develop staff expertise by sharing knowledge and experience.\r\nthere could be problems with selling services to existing clients. the technology may be of limited application to tt4u’s current\r\nclient base. they may lack the system capabilities to develop effectively and problems could damage tt4u’s standing with\r\nthem.\r\nrisks relating to security and also privacy have also been highlighted. depending on which services tt4u offers, it may be\r\nmore vulnerable to security breaches and also breaches of privacy regulations than for other services. these may result in legal\r\npenalties and significant threats to reputation.\r\ngovernment sector development\r\nadvantages of strategy\r\nthe policy of seeking more contracts in the government sector represents a form of market development if contracts are to\r\nbe obtained from more bodies. seeking more contracts systematically would represent a more coherent strategy in this area\r\nas contracts won previously appear to have been on a one-off basis. winning more contracts can lead to ‘success breeding\r\nsuccess’ with the target of becoming a preferred supplier to the government sector.\r\nmany opportunities appear likely to become available soon in the government sector. having been successful at fulfilling\r\nsmaller contracts for this sector, tt4u seems well-placed to seek larger contracts as it expands.\r\nthe contracts available will represent a cash stream which should be guaranteed for a number of years. this can be set off\r\nagainst shorter-term private sector work which may be more vulnerable to economic downturn. some of the contracts will be\r\nhigh profile, so winning them can provide good publicity for tt4u.\r\nconcerns with strategy\r\npossible issues with the work include profitability. whatever the exact priorities, government sector work will be concerned with\r\nthe 3es – economy, efficiency and effectiveness. because of the desire to meet economy targets, the margins available on the\r\nwork may be lower than on commercial contracts. serving the government sector effectively may also require investment in\r\nstaff who possess knowledge of the sector being served, for example, education.\r\nas noted above, public sector work is high profile. if there are major problems with contracts and these are publicised and\r\nblamed on tt4u, the company’s reputation could suffer seriously.\r\nthe argument that needing to provide innovative services will be less of an issue in the government sector may have some\r\nsubstance. however, one of the key aspects of the mieobed approach is encouraging clients to unlock value (for themselves\r\nand tt4u) in new fields of business development. the public sector may offer limited opportunities for that approach.\r\noperating the mieobed stakeholder approach may be more complex in the government sector because of the different\r\nstakeholders with differing objectives. the priorities of the government officials with whom tt4u deals may change if there is\r\na change of government and new conditions may be imposed.\r\ngovernments may use a number of strict indicators relating to value for money which tt4u has to fulfil. it may mean a greater\r\ndemand for resources and opportunity costs in taking staff away from other work. fulfilling government requirements will mean\r\nthat tt4u has to address quickly some of the service issues identified in the client survey.\r\nconclusion\r\nif the proposals are not mutually exclusive, tt4u may consider investing in both of them. they represent different types of\r\ndevelopment, so improving diversification, and have different risk-return profiles. investing in the internet-of-things is high risk\r\nbut could generate high earnings. investment in public sector work could provide steady cash flows to help fund investment in\r\nother areas.', '2021-08-02 01:29:13', '33', 1, '38')

asked me as someone outside the company to give my views on the controls which are significant in relation to threats to\r\ndata and also the comments made by the directors about the threat to reveal confidential information.\r\ncontrol issues\r\nyou rightly believe that tt4u cannot just say it has complete confidence in its controls and not give the issue further\r\nconsideration. tt4u has a fiduciary duty to take sufficient care to ensure confidential data remains secret. in addition, clients\r\nare very sensitive about the growing threat of cybercrime, indeed tt4u advises them on how to combat it. if it became public\r\nthat tt4u had been the victim of cybercrime through poor data protection practices, the loss of credibility for tt4u would\r\npotentially represent a big risk to income from existing and new services.\r\ni have no reason to doubt what the director says about the procedures already being in place. given that tt4u is advising\r\nclients on implementation of these procedures, it would be worrying if tt4u did not have them in place itself. however, you\r\nare right that there is a distinction between having the controls in place and the controls operating effectively. it is possible that\r\nlack of care or complacency may undermine the operation of important controls.\r\neven though tt4u has a system of access controls in place, this may be undermined by staff being careless with their\r\npassword security. more regular changing of passwords may reduce this threat. tt4u should also review who has access to\r\nwhich parts of the system and restrict permissions for staff so that they have the minimum of access rights which they require\r\nto carry out their work. access rights to the system must also be immediately terminated as soon as someone leaves tt4u.\r\nregular reminders to staff can help reduce complacency. this may particularly apply to having effective procedures to protect\r\nlaptops taken away from the office. these should have the same level of protection as devices kept in-house, including having\r\nanti-hacking protection as well as anti-virus software. they must be updated at the same time as in-house computers. staff\r\nshould also be told to avoid poor data security practices, for example, forbidding them to copy sensitive data onto memory\r\nsticks.\r\nas regards detection of someone obtaining information illicitly, you should start by looking at past and present staff who were\r\nable to access this data and considering whether there are any unusual or suspicious factors in relation to them. i assume the\r\nsystem logs failed attempts to log on, and this must be regularly reviewed in case any patterns appear to be emerging. you need\r\nalso to ensure you understand what represents ‘normal’ use of the system, which acts as a yardstick to use to detect unusual\r\npatterns of use, for example, copying of large amounts of data.\r\nthreat to reveal confidential information\r\neven if you have complete confidence in the control system, the threat cannot be brushed off, as the person contacting you\r\nhas clearly illicitly obtained specific information and may be threatening other companies. you should consider contacting the\r\nauthorities as they may be able to link the threats in with other cases. the authorities may insist on the client being informed.\r\nyou should not pay the sum demanded, as this is unethical and could lead to further threats.\r\nthere is a risk that rex investments’ confidence in tt4u may be undermined if it is told about this threat. i appreciate concerns\r\nhave been raised about client relations and it is quite possible that the client will ask for additional assurance on the controls\r\nwhich you operate.\r\nhowever, the risks relating to not telling rex investments are greater. disclosure of the information from other sources may\r\npermanently damage the relationship and may provide rex investments with a reason to terminate the contract. bad publicity\r\nrelating to this disclosure may mean other clients do not wish to use the data services you provide. it is likely to threaten the\r\nsuccess of the investment in the cloud-based services. more fundamentally, one aspect of the mieobed approach which you\r\nare planning to introduce is data security.\r\nfollowing the ethical principles of honesty and transparency would also suggest informing the client of a threat to its data.\r\nagain, i refer to mieobed, which is underpinned by the process of open communication with clients. failing to tell the client\r\nabout this threat would suggest that tt4u is not taking the mieobed approach seriously.\r\nlastly, it is possible that the person making the threats did not obtain the information from your systems but from rex\r\ninvestments. a further ethical reason for informing rex investments is that it may help in detecting who is making the threat\r\nand perhaps also highlight to the client shortcomings in their own procedures for keeping information confidential.\r\nplease contact me if you want to discuss these issues further.\r\nregards\r\nstubfield', '2021-08-02 01:29:13', '33', 1,

with the summary which has been prepared and recommends improvements and\r\nareas where further detail is required.\r\nnet present value calculation\r\nsales\r\nhaving a single sales revenue figure, even if this is a summary, is quite inadequate and the comment about the drivers of sale\r\nincreases is unhelpful. there is no justification for the varying % of sales increases; splitting the figure down by the services\r\noffered, at a minimum distinguishing the revenue from the provision of private cloud services from cloud integration services,\r\nwill give a better picture of how increasing the services offered may lead to revenue increases over time. the assumption about\r\nincreased client base needs to be linked to how new services are to be marketed, and how much the focus will be on winning\r\nnew clients as opposed to selling additional services to current clients. tt4u is operating in a very competitive market for cloud\r\nservices, so any assumptions about being able to increase prices are doubtful.\r\ncontribution\r\nif different services are provided, contribution may vary on them. a figure chosen may do as a broad estimate, if it is the sort\r\nof margin which tt4u has been generating recently. however, there is no detail about variable costs. these may change over\r\ntime as the service offered becomes more mature and the cost per client of providing each service falls.\r\nother costs\r\nthe marketing costs will depend on when new services are introduced. if they are introduced gradually over the three-year\r\nperiod, the estimates may be reasonable. however, if most of the services are being introduced soon, marketing is likely\r\nto peak in year 1. the fixed costs figure appears to be a general estimate. no justification is given as to why the figure is\r\nunchanged over time. in addition, the figure is sufficiently large to need breaking down into different elements and clarifying\r\nthe assumptions for each element.\r\ntax and working capital\r\nusing the current tax rate is a reasonable assumption if it is not expected to change much in the next few years. however, the\r\nfigure does not take account of any allowances which may be available on the investment expenditure. it would also be likely\r\nthat the investment would require some working capital and this needs to be brought into the calculation.\r\ninvestment\r\nif services are likely to be developed over the next few years, then a single immediate figure for investment at the start will not\r\nbe realistic. the realisable value given at year 4 lacks justification. it is difficult to see what would be realised and whether it\r\nwould have any value, given the fast-changing nature of the industry.\r\nif the net present value figure is extended to year 10, the realisable value should be excluded from the calculation as the\r\ninvestment is not finishing at year 4. taking the post-tax cash flow at year 4 and using a multiple of 6 as the basis for years\r\n5–10 has not been justified. the figure used should be discounted at the relevant discount factor for each year, not the discount\r\nfactor for year 4. it is ultimately, however, questionable whether the investment should be extended to 10 years, as this seems\r\na long period for an investment in fast-changing it.\r\ndiscount rate\r\nthe discount rate used is incorrect. the weighted average cost of capital should be used if business and financial risk remain\r\nat the same levels. this is likely to be higher than the cost of debt, since equity has a higher cost than debt, meaning the net\r\npresent value will be smaller. if either risk changes significantly, a project-specific cost of capital should be used.\r\npayback period calculation\r\nthe approach taken to calculate the payback period is correct, although the figures may not be reliable due to the concerns\r\nraised above. net present value is theoretically the best method to determine whether an investment should be undertaken.\r\nhowever, payback can be used as an initial indication if directors are uncertain about the timeframe over which the investment\r\nwill be profitable and want to ensure it is recouped quickly. the investment is only marginally outside the payback period and\r\nthe uncertainties connected with the figures suggest the investment should not necessarily be rejected because it fails to meet\r\nthe payback criterion.\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nthe summary is incorrect in saying that sensitivity analysis will show the probability of making a loss. it will just show the\r\namount by which figures need to change for the investment to make a loss. sensitivity analysis also treats individual figures\r\nas independent variables, whereas there may be connections between them (for example, between revenue and marketing\r\nexpenditure) or the same factors may affect more than one variable (for example, competitor response affecting income from\r\nmore than one service). scenario analysis, showing results under different optimistic/pessimistic outcomes, is likely to be more\r\nvaluable.\r\nconclusion\r\nthe project’s failure to meet the payback target period should not by itself lead to the project being rejected. the decision should\r\nbe primarily based on a revised npv calculation using the correct cost of capital and re-considering the assumptions. if the\r\nrevised npv calculation shows a positive present value for years 1–4 only, the board should consider accepting the project.', '2021-08-02 01:29:13', '33', 1,
